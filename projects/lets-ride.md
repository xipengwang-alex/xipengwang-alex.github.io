Let's Ride is a web application that I helped create as a team project. It provides users with statistics about NFL games, teams, players, and coaches. The application allows users to view details about current games, teams, players, team history, and game day information. Users can also predict game day scores based on previous team performance. The application is built using React and Node on the frontend, Flask and Python on the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database system. The project provides a platform for users to stay informed about games and players and make predictions based on historical data.

During this project, I gained experience in full-stack web application development. I contributed to the backend-frontend communication and managed the PostgreSQL database, while working collaboratively with a talented team.
